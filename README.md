## Package Manager

Yarn will be used as a package manager for this project. Please do not use npm, as using both will create conflicts in the lock files.

You can install dependencies using the command: `yarn`

Add dependencies using the command: `yarn add [package name]`

Adding `--dev` if the dependency is only for development i.e. linters etc.

## Version Control

When contributing to the project, always create a new branch to make your changes. Then once you have completed the task you were working on, create a pull request to merge those changes into the master branch.

Most IDE's have version control functionalities built in. I (Michael) use WebStorm, which is free for students, but VS code is also a good alternative.

## Running the Project

This step will evolve over time, but usually running the project will mean executing the command: `yarn run [script]`

You can see the list of scripts in the `package.json` of each component.
